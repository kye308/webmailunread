Display unread count in title for Caltech Webmail.

First, clone this repo into a local directory, and then load it from chrome://extensions, and you're good to go.

NOTE: The extension only updates when you refresh the page, but webmail can update by running a php script that doesn't reload the page. I'm not really sure what to do about that...
